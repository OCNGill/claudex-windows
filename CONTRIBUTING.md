## Code Style Guidelines

- Follow [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) conventions
- Use `gofmt` for formatting (non-negotiable)
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add godoc comments for exported functions and types
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Handle errors explicitly - never ignore them
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Testing Requirements

- Write table-driven tests for new functionality
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use `t.Run()` for subtests
- Ensure tests are deterministic and don't rely on timing
